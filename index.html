            <span class="first_letter">Hi!</span> I'm Animesh Deb, currently in my senior year at The City College of New York, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Beyond academics, I find joy in reading books, indulging in video games, and delving into the world of web development.

            Naturally, my aspirations lean towards becoming a proficient Web Developer. The allure lies in the blend of creativity and technology that the field offers. Crafting something impactful from mere lines of code ignites my passion.
            
            My career path is driven by a desire to make a positive impact on individuals, and web development aligns seamlessly with this goal. It grants me the chance to not only bring ideas to life but also assist people through digital solutions.
            
            My vision is to evolve into a versatile full-stack Web Developer, crafting websites and web applications catering to a diverse range of clients, from individuals to businesses.
